# Research Progress

## Checkpoint: 2026-08-21

This checkpoint stops after the first deterministic discourse-graph probe and
the first three blinded refinement comparisons. It is an exploratory research
checkpoint, not a product milestone.

## Completed work

- Preserved 10 quick reader-friction ratings with an ordinal continue-reading
  outcome and optional verbatim comments.
- Kept time as the primary comparison axis: pre-2023 versus 2025-07 and later.
- Restricted the reader-friction association analysis to the eight post-period
  passages; the two pre-period ratings are a separate sensitivity analysis.
- Implemented feature-wise Huber weighting inside each time cohort so isolated
  documents lose influence without being manually deleted.
- Implemented a deterministic heterogeneous discourse graph using Stanza
  dependency parses, propositions, entities, abstract concepts, and adjacent
  discourse bridges.
- Compared 161 document features on 10 pre-period and 10 post-period InfoQ
  documents with 5,000 fixed-seed label permutations and
  leave-one-document-out stability.
- Prepared and completed three blinded minimal-edit comparisons targeting
  formulaic contrastive and emphatic reframing.

## Current evidence

The strongest interpretable time-and-reader intersection is the complete
contrast frame shaped like `不是/并非/不再是 ... 而是 ...`:

- robust post-minus-pre effect: 1.51;
- time-comparison permutation p: 0.033;
- post-only reader-friction Spearman rho: 0.78;
- reader exact permutation p: 0.036;
- both directions are stable under leave-one-out removal.

These p-values are exploratory. Neither result survives the full expanded
multiple-testing correction, and the reader analysis contains only eight
post-period passages with two observed rating levels.

Graph directions align with the reader hypothesis but remain weaker:

- mean adjacent discourse bridge is lower post-period and lower in disliked
  passages;
- mainline detour ratio is higher post-period and higher in disliked passages;
- abstract-shell and unsupported-edge ratios move in the expected direction.

Exact predicate-signature repetition failed. It moves in opposite directions
between the full time comparison and the rated passages, so it must not be used
as a semantic-restatement detector.

## First intervention result

Three contrast-reduction variants were compared blindly with their originals:

| Outcome | Count |
|---|---:|
| Revised version clearly preferred | 2 |
| Original clearly preferred | 0 |
| Tie or both bad | 1 |

The two wins show that removing repeated framing and stating the mechanism
directly can materially improve clarity. Both winning edits were described as
too emotionally flat. The failed edit removed too many explicit grammatical
arguments; the reader found its omitted subjects, predicates, or objects
effortful even though the original retained obvious formulaic AI patterns.

The next edit operator therefore needs two additional constraints:

1. preserve explicit subject-predicate-object structure across sentence
   boundaries;
2. preserve an appropriate amount of voice and rhythm instead of maximizing
   compression.

This pilot does not yet validate formulaic contrast as a product rule.

## Outlier policy and current limitation

Documents are not hard-deleted because one reader dislikes them. Robust weights
are computed separately by cohort and feature. The disliked 2022 Red Hat
passage remains in the stored ratings but does not enter the post-only
reader-friction association.

The current generic document-typicality summary did not confidently rank that
Red Hat document as the strongest pre-period outlier. This is a representation
failure to improve with larger matched data, not a reason to insert a manual
weight. Overall document typicality remains descriptive; only feature-wise
weights are used in the current time comparison.

## Reproducible artifacts

- `data/annotations/reader-friction-v1.json`: 10 quick ratings.
- `data/annotations/refinement-pairwise-v1.json`: three blinded A/B outcomes.
- `src/deaiodorant/analysis/discourse_graph.py`: graph schema and metrics.
- `experiments/analyze_reader_friction.py`: post-only ordinal association.
- `experiments/robust_typicality_probe.py`: cohort-wise Huber analysis.
- `experiments/prepare_refinement_pairs.py`: frozen three-pair intervention.
- `experiments/discourse-graph-probe.md`: method and detailed evidence.
- `docs/smell-catalog.md`: evidence-status integration.

Generated `feature_runs/` artifacts and local Stanza weights are intentionally
ignored. They can be reproduced from the tracked pilot corpus and scripts.

## Next research step

Do not build a product interface or train a general classifier. Continue with a
second intervention batch on new post-period passages:

1. freeze a revised contrast-reduction operator before reading new outcomes;
2. keep explicit grammatical arguments and preserve moderate voice;
3. select 10 new passages without reusing the three exposed intervention
   passages;
4. log every edit operation and preservation check;
5. collect one low-burden blinded continue-reading preference per pair;
6. retain unchanged, failed, and rejected variants as evidence.

In parallel, run the same graph features on the larger matched corpus when it
arrives. Match source, topic, format, length, and visibility before interpreting
the time effect.
